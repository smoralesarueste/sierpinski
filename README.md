# Order out of Chaos

Creating one of the most famous fractals by using randomness.
So, you have probably heard about the Sierpinski Triangle. And if you haven't heard about it, you probably have encountered it at some point.

It feels so in order, full of patterns. But what if we could create such a figure out of pure randomness? 
This is called *The Chaos Game* (you read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game). The procedure goes as follows: 

1. Choose a point within the starting triangle and mark it. 
2. Randomly choose one of the three corners. 
3. Walk halfway to that corner, and mark the new spot. 
4. Repeat until you get bored. 


That's it. Wait a bit and it will draw itself. No kidding. 
Here you can check a code to create a GIF showing how it just magically apperead, and the resulting animation.
